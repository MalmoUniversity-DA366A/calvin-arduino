##Why Github?

We chose Github as version control so that all the members are able to work on the same project at the same time on different machines. With Github we will be synchronized to the remote repository on all machines.

###Branch Model

We decided to setup our Github repository with 3 infinite lifetime branches, develop, master and release. Which is based upon "A successful Git branching model" (<http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>) by Vincent Driessen.

There are also several temporary feature branches named with appropriate names created from the develop branch. These feature branches are created for each new feature set and killed upon the completion of the task. The progress from the feature task is merged to the develop branch once the code has passed testing. Finished code from the develop branch is merged with the release branch after a full system testing and documentation. The branches are accessed through MalmoUniversity-DA366A/calvin-arduino repository.

###How-To

This describes how to get an remote repository to an existing local directory. First a Github shell needs to be installed. A program called Github Desktop contains both a desktop client and a shell.

* Download and install Github Desktop: (https://desktop.github.com/) (Installation automatically creates a Github folder in Documents)

* Start Git Shell program (Program starts automatically in your Github folder)

The command git clone which gives the user a full copy of the data from the remote repository on Github.

####Calvin-Arduino
* git clone https://github.com/MalmoUniversity-DA366A/calvin-arduino.git

####Calvin-Base
* git clone https://github.com/MalmoUniversity-DA366A/calvin-base.git

####Calvin-Mini
* git clone https://github.com/MalmoUniversity-DA366A/calvin-mini.git

#### Step into calvin-arduino folder
* cd calvin-arduino

####Branch a new feature from _develop_ branch
* git checkout develop (if not already in develop, step into develop branch)
* git checkout -b newBranchName (create new feature branch from develop branch)

####Check branch updates/changes
* git status (also displays uncommitted added files)

####Download latest up-to-date version of branch
* git pull

####Commit local work to branch
* git add . (adds all files)
* git commit -m "message describing what you have done" (always write a message)

####Push work to repository
* git push

####Merge feature branch with develop branch
* git checkout develop (step into develop branch before merging)
* git merge --no-ff myNewBranchName (merge myNewBranchName with develop branch and no default fast forward mode to keep branch history)

####Kill an obsolete merged feature branch
* git branch â€“d myNewBranchName

####Ignore and/or delete the hidden Mac file .DS_Store
* defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES (Show hidden files/folders)
* Add the line: .DS_Store to the hidden .gitignore file in the repository
* find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch (Removes DS_Store file if already committed)
* For any other file/folder than .DS_Store: git rm -r --cached filename/foldername(Removes from Github but not local)
* git add .gitignore 
* git commit -m ".DS_Store banished!"
* defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool NO (Hide hidden files/folders)
